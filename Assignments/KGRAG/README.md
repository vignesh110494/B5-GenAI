# Knowledge Graph vs Traditional RAG Demo

A comprehensive demonstration comparing Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Knowledge Graph-based RAG using LangChain, Graphiti, and Neo4j.

## Overview

This project showcases the advantages of Knowledge Graph-based RAG systems over Traditional vector similarity RAG by:

- **Query Response Quality**: Side-by-side comparison of answers
- **Relationship Discovery**: Demonstrating how KGs capture entity relationships that RAG misses
- **Visual Exploration**: Interactive graph visualization
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed comparison of retrieval time, accuracy, and context richness

## Architecture

### Traditional RAG
- **Vector Store**: FAISS for fast similarity search
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
- **LLM**: GPT-4 Turbo
- **Approach**: Chunks documents → Embeds → Retrieves top-k similar chunks → Generates answer

### Knowledge Graph RAG
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for storing entities and relationships
- **Framework**: Graphiti for automatic entity/relationship extraction
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
- **LLM**: GPT-4 Turbo
- **Approach**: Extracts entities & relationships → Builds knowledge graph → Traverses graph for relevant facts → Generates answer

## Key Advantages of Knowledge Graphs

1. **Structured Context**: Understands relationships between entities (e.g., "AuthenticationService depends on UserManager")
2. **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Can traverse relationships to find connected information
3. **Entity-Centric**: Maintains entity identities across the entire corpus
4. **Relationship Awareness**: Explicitly captures "depends on", "interacts with", "uses" relationships
5. **Better for Complex Queries**: Excels at questions about system architecture and dependencies

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (for Neo4j)
- OpenAI API key
- 8GB RAM recommended

## Running the Demo

### Start the Interactive Demo

```bash
python demo.py
```

### Demo Menu Options

1. **Run Single Question Comparison**
   - Compare both systems on one question
   - **Interactive question picker**: A table shows suggested questions; enter **1–6** to pick one, **0** for a random suggestion, or type your own question
   - Invalid input is validated and you can try again
   - Your chosen question is echoed in a panel before both systems are queried
   - Results are shown step-by-step: question → Traditional RAG answer → press Enter → Knowledge Graph answer → press Enter → metrics and insights

2. **Run Full Comparison Suite**
   - Test all 6 predefined questions
   - Generate comprehensive metrics
   - Create visualization plots

3. **Visualize Knowledge Graph**
   - Generate interactive HTML visualization
   - Explore entities and relationships
   - Color-coded by node type

4. **Interactive Mode**
   - Ask unlimited questions about the Python best practices / sample docs
   - Type **list** (or **suggest**) to see suggested questions without leaving the mode
   - Type **exit** (or **quit**, **q**) to return to the main menu
   - Each answer is shown in a step-by-step layout with "Press Enter" between sections
   - Reminder after each answer: ask another, use **list** for ideas, or **exit** to quit

5. **View Graph Statistics**
   - See node and relationship counts
   - Understand graph complexity

## Understanding the Results

### Interactive Result Display

When you run a single comparison or use Interactive Mode, results are shown in a **step-by-step layout**:

1. **Question** – Shown in a highlighted panel so you can confirm what was asked.
2. **Traditional RAG Answer** – First answer in a blue-bordered panel.
3. **Press Enter to see Knowledge Graph answer** – Lets you read the first answer before continuing.
4. **Knowledge Graph RAG Answer** – Second answer in a magenta-bordered panel.
5. **Press Enter to see metrics** – Then a **Performance Metrics** table and **Key Insights** bullets.

This flow keeps the comparison easy to follow and avoids scrolling past long answers before seeing metrics.

### Key Metrics

- **Query Time**: Total time to retrieve and generate answer
- **Source Chunks (RAG)**: Number of text chunks retrieved
- **Facts (KG)**: Number of knowledge graph facts retrieved
- **Entities (KG)**: Number of entities involved in the answer
- **Relationships (KG)**: Number of relationships traversed

### What to Look For

1. **Richer Context**: KG typically finds more related facts
2. **Entity Awareness**: KG explicitly identifies entities
3. **Relationship Discovery**: KG reveals connections RAG misses
4. **Better for "How" Questions**: KG excels at explaining relationships

## Sample Questions (Built-in Demo)

The demo ships with 6 predefined questions (shown in a table when you run single comparison or type **list** in Interactive Mode). Examples:

1. **"What is PEP 8 and why is it important in Python projects?"**
2. **"What is the recommended indentation and line length in Python?"**
3. **"Why should variable and function names be descriptive?"**
4. **"Why should global variables be avoided?"**
5. **"When should constants be used, and how should they be named?"**
6. **"What are the differences between list, tuple, set, and dictionary?"**

You can also type **any** question; both RAG and Knowledge Graph systems will answer using the loaded sample data (e.g. Python best practices).

## Visualizations

### Knowledge Graph Visualization

After running option 3, open `knowledge_graph.html` in your browser to see:
- **Red nodes**: Entities (services, components)
- **Green nodes**: Episodes (document chunks)
- **Orange nodes**: Facts
- **Edges**: Relationships between nodes

### Comparison Metrics Plot

After running the full suite, `comparison_metrics.png` shows:
- Query time comparison
- Retrieved items comparison
- Entities and relationships graph
- Average metrics summary

## Troubleshooting

### Neo4j Connection Issues

**Error**: `Failed to establish connection to Neo4j`

**Solution**:
1. Verify Neo4j is running: `docker ps`
2. Check port 7687 is accessible
3. Verify credentials in `.env` match `docker-compose.yml`

### OpenAI API Errors

**Error**: `Invalid API key` or `Rate limit exceeded`

**Solution**:
1. Verify API key is correct in `.env`
2. Check your OpenAI account has available credits
3. Reduce request rate if hitting limits

### Memory Issues

**Error**: Process killed or out of memory

**Solution**:
1. Reduce `chunk_size` in `rag_pipeline.py` (line 28)
2. Process fewer documents at once
3. Increase Docker memory allocation

### Import Errors

**Error**: `ModuleNotFoundError`

**Solution**:
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Graphiti Build Issues

**Error**: Building knowledge graph takes too long

**Solution**:
1. This is normal - KG building is more intensive than vector indexing
2. Reduce document size for faster testing
3. Graph is cached - subsequent runs use existing graph

## Presenting the Demo

### Recommended Flow for Mixed Audience

1. **Start with Overview** (2 min)
   - Explain what RAG is
   - Introduce Knowledge Graphs concept

2. **Run Single Comparison** (5 min)
   - Use the suggestions table: pick by number (1–6), try **0** for a random question, or type your own
   - Walk through the step-by-step results (RAG answer → Enter → KG answer → Enter → metrics)
   - Highlight KG advantages

3. **Show Visualization** (3 min)
   - Open knowledge_graph.html
   - Zoom into interesting entity clusters
   - Show relationship paths

4. **Run Interactive Demo** (5-10 min)
   - Take questions from audience; type **list** anytime to show suggested questions
   - Compare answers live using the interactive result display
   - Discuss differences

5. **Show Metrics** (3 min)
   - Display comparison_metrics.png
   - Discuss trade-offs
   - Explain when to use each approach

### Key Talking Points

- **Traditional RAG**: Fast, simple, good for straightforward Q&A
- **Knowledge Graph**: Better for complex queries, relationship-heavy domains
- **Trade-offs**: KG requires more setup but provides richer context
- **Use Cases**: KG excels in technical documentation, enterprise knowledge bases

## Customizing for Your Domain
